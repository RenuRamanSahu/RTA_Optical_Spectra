# RTA_Optical_Spectra
A spectrometer program based on ocean-optics seabreeze. It can measure, temperature dependent reflection, transmission and absorption data.


1. Make sure that you have installed seabreeze library. It is required to obtain data from the ocean-optics spectrometer.
2. Download all the files from this repository and run the python file.
3. The files "brightR.txt", "darkR.txt", "brightT.txt", "darkT.txt", will be updated once you normalise during the experiment.
4. The hardware tutorial is available at https://youtu.be/MxYhKNgo6wo
